# Rust System Programming

This repository hosts codes that act as my personal milestone in learning about system programming using Rust. The codes here are translated from the excellent book "Go System Programming" by Mihalis Tsoukalos (Packtpub, 2017). 

# Background
Since 2016, I've been learning Rust (on-and-off), mostly wrestling with its syntax and borrow checker. However, this year, I'm aiming to learn deeper and to achieve that, I'm looking at what can I actually build using Rust that respects its core concept as a system programming language. 

along the way, I encountered Mihalis' book that's full of practical system programming projects. The book is written for Go, so I think, it's a good starting point: I can learn about system programming while comparing Rust and Go even further. Thus, this project was born.

# Goal
The goal of the project is simple: to translate the Go codes in the book into Rust. Steps on building the actual system tools are exhibited from chapter 5 onwards, so that's my entry point.
